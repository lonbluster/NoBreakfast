**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) and [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in _blogging_, _instant messaging_, _online forums_, _collaborative software_, _documentation pages_, and _readme files_.
